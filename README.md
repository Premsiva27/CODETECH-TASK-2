It allows users to add, edit, mark as complete, or delete tasks in a structured and user-friendly manner to boost productivity and stay on top of their daily activities.

Objectives: The main objective of a To-Do List project is to provide a simple and efficient tool for users to manage their tasks, prioritize activities, and track their progress. The project aims to improve task organization and time management for personal or professional purposes.

Features of the Project: The project includes features such as adding tasks with a title and description, editing or deleting tasks, marking tasks as completed, and filtering tasks by status. Advanced features may include setting due dates, reminders, categorizing tasks by type, and syncing across multiple devices.

Technologies: The To-Do List project can use frontend technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive interface.
